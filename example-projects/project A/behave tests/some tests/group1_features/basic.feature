Feature: Basic

   Scenario: run a successful test
      Given we have behave installed
      When we implement a successful test
      Then we will see the result

   Scenario: run a slow test for async testing
      Given we have behave installed
      When we implement a test that takes 4 seconds
      Then we will see the result

   Scenario: run another slow test for async testing
      Given we have behave installed
      When we implement a test that takes 1.5 seconds
      Then we will see the result

   Scenario: run a failing test
      Given we have behave installed
      When we implement a failing test
      Then we will see the result     

   Scenario: run another successful test
      Given we have behave installed
      When we implement a successful test
      Then we will see the result      

   Scenario: run a test with a missing steps
      Given we have behave installed
      When we have a missing step
      Then we will see the result         

   @skip
   Scenario: run a skipped test
      Given we have behave installed

   Scenario: succeed with a long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long name
      Given we have behave installed
      When we implement a successful test
      Then we will see the result    

   Scenario: run a test with a "quoted" scenario
      Given we have behave installed
